# Wavebreaker-Frontend

**Extremely WIP** frontend for [Wavebreaker](https://github.com/AudiosurfResearch/Wavebreaker), a reimplementation of Audiosurf's online services.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Thanks

This project uses a few things from ScoreSaber's frontend (like the entirety of src/lib/utils/accio), which is open-source and licensed under the MIT license.
